# Marwadi-University-Chats

I saw video in which Mark Zuckerberg says his first project was chat system. I got inspired from that and tried to make such thing. It isn't that good but I tried to do something. I named it as MU-Chats, I'll work on this more and make it more creative and allow user to chat from their devices. For doing this still more to learn :)

//ChatBot

Step 1: Enter name of 1st person

Step 2: Enter name of 2nd person

Step 3: Start chatting

Step 4: To end the chat type "$end$" (This will save your chat in chat_history.txt file) But If you end chat with CTRL+C then your chat history will not be stored ;)
